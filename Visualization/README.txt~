****Information*****
1. It is very cumbersome to input lengthy commands in the command prompt. Therefore, I have designed a simple UI based application for it. In the application, you can select the input data file, the type of count you want to calculate(i.e.simple word count/hash word count/@word count). 

2. When the user presses "Calculate" button, the whole processing is done in the background.

3. After the all processing, a HTML file is generated and default web browser is invoked automatically.

4. That HTML file publishes the word cloud with respect to the input file which the user had chosen earlier.

5. By repeating the same process for different files, we can collect as many outputs as the number of input files. 

6. Since input files are generated by a automated script, the number of files will increase with time and more and more data will become available for the analysis.

****Assumptions*****
********************
1. It is assumed that the user will create exactly same directory structure as mentioned in the README.txt, since the automated script should get the correct path to store the fetched data.


****Contents******
******************
1. Screenshots : Screenshots of the application are given in this folder.
2. TwitterData : This folder should be directly imported to Eclipse and run. This contains the automated application that will help user to calculate count and view word clouds without entering commands in command prompt.
(To run the whole application please copy DIC_Twitter folder to /home/cloudera folder, because, a directory structre has been maintained throughout the application and it will be easy to keep track of folders.)
3. smallData.txt : Sample small data set
4. README.txt
5. ProjectReport.pdf : A project report menioning outputs and analysis of outputs.

****Some Observations About Data****
************************************
1. While browsing through the generated count files, observed that people like to use smilies i.e. :-),<(,etc., short forms, various links while tweetting. Since I have collected love related data, I may vaguely say that sad smilies are indication are problems with relationships. So, for a certain day if you see more number sad smilies, you can guess that the links which are shared over tweets may lead to sad songs,videos,etc. Maybe this is too early to conclude like that. We have to process those links to arrive at a firm conclusion. 


****Further Studies*****
************************
By processing tweets regionwise, nationwise, timewise,etc. many interesting results can be obtained.
